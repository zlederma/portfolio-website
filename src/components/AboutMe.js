                                    Determined, fast-learning and detail oriented UC: San Diego graduate with a degree in Cognitive Science (Design and Interaction) and a minor in Computer Science.

                                    As a developer I am experienced in using frontend technologies such as Javascript, React, Vue, and Bootstrap to create dynamic and responsive web applications. I am also interested in learning to utilize new languages and tools to become a better developer. While I am both a developer and a designer, I am more focused on the development process.  </p>

                                    Human centered design is especially important in an increasingly digital world. This is one of the aspects of design I am passionate about. Taking what I have learned about how humans think; such as how we process information, cognitive biases, and heuristics, in order to create a user-friendly design. I am good at connecting ideas and looking at the whole picture in a design challenge, while still remaining detail-oriented.</p>
