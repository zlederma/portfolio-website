Iâ€™m also a rock climber, a cat fanatic, and book lover. Former REI Frontend Software Developer Intern, who is now seeking full time development roles!

                                I have experience in using frontend technologies such as Javascript, React, and Vue to create dynamic and responsive web applications. I am fascinated by and invested in learning to utilize new languages and tools to become a better developer.

                                I have a background in UI/UX Design - including user research, user testing and prototyping. While I am happy to bring this skill set to the table, development is where my passion lies. However, understanding UI/UX design gives me a head start in clearly and productively communicating with designers, along with helping me to succeed in the visual aspects of frontend development.
